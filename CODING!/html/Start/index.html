    <p style="width: 25%">
      French Roast coffee is known for its bold, robust flavor and deep, dark
      color, which comes from the beans being roasted to a rich, almost
      charcoal-like finish. This roasting process imparts a smoky, slightly
      bitter taste with hints of caramelized sweetness, making it a favorite
      among those who enjoy a strong, intense cup of coffee. The beans used in
      French Roast are typically Arabica, and the dark roast helps to bring out
      the full-bodied richness that defines this classic coffee style.

    <p style="width: 25%">
      Colombian Roast coffee is celebrated for its smooth, well-balanced flavor
      and rich aroma. Sourced from the high-altitude regions of Colombia, these
      beans are roasted to a medium-dark level, which enhances their natural
      notes of caramel, chocolate, and a hint of nuttiness. This roast profile
      brings out a full-bodied taste with a bright acidity and a pleasant,
      lingering finish. Colombian Roast offers a harmonious blend of robustness
      and subtlety, making it a popular choice for those who appreciate a
      flavorful yet approachable cup of coffee.
