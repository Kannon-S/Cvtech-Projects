    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Kannon Smith and I am a senior at Yukon High School. I
      am 18 years old and I love Basketball and my favorite subject is math.
      After school I usually just relax and play video games. My goal in life is
      to become a programmer and eventually make my own programming business and
      work for myself. My main reason of wanting to do this is so I can travel
      and enjoy my life while also doing the work I love doing.
